                <h1>Turtle Hatchery Hikkaduwa</h1>
                <p>If you're in Hikkaduwa, the sea turtle hatchery is a lovely spot to visit. If you love animals, seeing the turtles in person is a great experience. It's a family-run conservation hatchery, A guy by the name of Ariyapala established it and passed it on to his daughter, who tragically died in the tsunami of 2004, Ariyapala's son took over and rebuilt the hatchery with assistance from abroad.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Now its a home for many sea turtles that need help to protect their life from many threats...</h4>
                <h5>Conservation Projects</h5>
                <p>The hatchery and rescue facility currently cares for five different species of turtles. These species include the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. Modern water tanks are included in the facilities at the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center, which also cares for adult turtle species that have been pulled from the water after suffering injuries. The place where the turtles lay their eggs, which has distinct small mounds of sand piled neatly between one another, is one of the more odd sights in the center. Each of these mounds is closely observed to determine when the turtle eggs will hatch.
